## About me

I am a full-stack web development enthusiast living and working near Cambridge, UK. I tend to code in Python, Javascript or Typescript, but as an addicted autodidact I’m always looking to learn new languages, frameworks, patterns and paradigms. I work as a Front End Web Developer for [Cydar](https://www.cydarmedical.com).

When I’m not coding, I’m learning Spanish, playing guitar, reading, or studying some topic or other that has sparked my interest.

This is my place to record and share some of what I learn, to say “hey, look what I made!”, and to document my journey towards hopefully becoming a better and better developer. I’m mainly talking to myself, but doing to publicly drastically improves the quality of the conversation. If you find what I have written useful, that’s a wonderful bonus.
